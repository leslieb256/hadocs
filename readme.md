# airgradient-prodiy.yaml
The purpose of this yaml is to be used with ESP Home to allow the airgradient sensors to be picked up by home assistant.

This airgradient pro diy yaml has been tested with my setup:
 - Airgradient PCB: v3.3 (pro DIY)
 - Wemos D1 Mini v4
 - SenseAir S8 Co2 detector
 - SGP40
 - PMS5003
 - SHT3X
 
It was created by combining parts of the following two yaml sources:
  - https://github.com/ajfriesen/ESPHome-AirGradient - as the basis of the yaml
  - https://gist.github.com/halomademeapc/f301822bcbf053783bb04f902c74865a#file-readme-md - for the pretty display

The material design font used was: https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Font
